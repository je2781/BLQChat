BLQChatApp
=========

## development
I started with designing the models/interfaces for the repos, response, requests, used in the sendbird chat api consumption. After the sendbird api started responding, I designed widgets to cater for messages sent every minute. The chat screen was last, ensuring only registered users could send chats. 

## How to run the app

From the main directory, run (flutter run) to start gradle build. The first build is always long to complete, but when it's done, the installed app can be deployed on an emulator
